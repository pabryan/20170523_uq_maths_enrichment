** Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction
- Based on Newton's law of cooling
 - Change in thermal energy \(Q\) equals temperature difference \(\delta T\)
 - \(\tfrac{d Q}{dt} = \delta T\) \pause

- Fourier's Law:
  - \(\vec{q} = - \nabla T\)
  - Heat flux \(\vec{q}\) (heat flow across a surface) \pause
  - Leads to the *heat equation*
    \[
    \partial_t T = \Delta T = \partial_x^2 T + \partial_y^2 T + \partial_z^2 T.

\begin{align*}
u_1(x, t) &= e^{-t} \sin(x) &\Rightarrow &\partial_t u_1 = -e^{t} \sin(x) = \partial_x^2 u_1 \\
u_n(x, t) &= e^{-n^2 t} \sin(n x) &\Rightarrow &\partial_t u_n = \partial_x^2 u_n.
\end{align*}

Let \(u(x, t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n e^{-n^2 t} \sin(n x)\) where \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n < \infty\) \pause

\partial_t u &= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \partial_t \left(c_n e^{-n^2 t} \sin(n x)\right) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} -n^2 c_n e^{-n^2 t} \sin(n x) \\
&= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \partial_x^2 \left(c_n e^{-n^2 t} \sin(n x)\right) = \partial_x^2 u.

** Solving by infinite series II
- Can also replace \(\sin\) by \(\cos\). \pause
*** Questions
- Does \(T = \sum e^{-n^2 t} (c_n \sin(nx) + d_n \cos(nx))\) for some constants \(c_n, d_n\)? \pause
- If so, are these constants unique? \pause
- Does the series necessarily converge? \pause
- Does \(T\) need to be continuous, differentiable, ...?

** Uniqueness of Fourier Series (Riemann)

    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
*If* \(f\) is continuous and for all \(x \in [0, 2\pi]\),
\[
f(x) = \sum c_n \sin(nx) + d_n \cos(nx) = \sum c_n' \sin(nx) + d_n' \cos(nx)
\]

*Then* \(c_n = c_n'\) and \(d_n = d_n'\) for every \(n\). \pause
*** Suffices by linearity to show
*If* \(\sum c_n \sin(nx) + d_n \cos(nx) = 0\) for all \(x \in [0, 2\pi]\)

*Then* \(c_n = d_n = 0\) for every \(n\).

** Uniqueness of Fourier Series (Cantor) I
*** Cantor
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
*If* for all \(x \in [0, 2\pi]\) except at most finitely many \(x\),
\[
f(x) = \sum c_n \sin(nx) + d_n \cos(nx) = \sum c_n' \sin(nx) + d_n' \cos(nx)
\]

*Then* \(c_n = c_n'\) and \(d_n = d_n'\) for every \(n\).

** Uniqueness of Fourier Series (Cantor) I: Proof
- (Riemman) Let \(F(x) = \int \int f(x) dx = \frac{1}{2} (c_0 + d_0)x^2 - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} (c_n \sin(nx) + d_n \cos(nx))\) \pause
- Formally \(F''(x) = f(x) = 0\) (\(=0\) by assumption) hence \(F(x) = Ax + B\) \pause
- But for all but at most finitely many \(x\),
  #+BEGIN_latex
  \[
  \begin{split}
  0 &= f(x) = F(x) - \frac{1}{2} (c_0 + d_0)x^2 + (c_0 + d_0) \\
  &= (B + c_0 + d_0) + Ax - \frac{1}{2} (c_0 + d_0)x^2.
  \end{split}
  \]
  #+END_latex
  \pause
- Therefore \(c_0 + d_0 = 0\), \(A = 0\) and \(B = 0\) \pause
  - Either send \(x \to \infty\) or note polynomials have at most finitely many roots. \pause
- Further arguments give \(c_n = d_n = 0\) (not difficult but too far from our purpose here)
** Derived Sets
- Let \(X \subseteq \RR\) be a set of real numbers.
- Limit Points of \(X\):
  \[
  X' = \{y \in X : \forall \epsilon > 0, \left((y - \epsilon, y) \union (y, y + \epsilon)\right) \cap X \ne \emptyset\}.
  \]
  i.e. every interval containing \(y\) contains a point in \(X\), not equal to \(y\) \pause
- First derived set: \(X' = \{\) limit points of \(X\}\). \pause
- Second derived set: \(X'' = (X')'\). \pause
- \(n\)-th derived set: \(X^{(n)} = (X^{(n-1)})'\). \pause
*** Example
- \(A_i = \{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{i} : n > i(i-1), n \in \NN\} \subseteq [\tfrac{1}{i}, \frac{1}{i-1}]\)
- \(A = \union_{i=2}^{\infty} A_i\)
- \(A' = \{0\} \union \{\frac{1}{n} : n \geq 2, n \in \NN\}\), \(A'' = \{0\}\), \(A''' = \emptyset\).
** Uniqueness of Fourier Series (Cantor) II
A set \(X\) is called a /derived set of the \(n\)-th kind/ if \(X^{(n)}\) is a finite set. \pause
- The set \(A\) on the previous slide is an /infinite/ derived set of the second kind.
- If \(X\) is a derived set of the \(n\)-th kind, then \(X^{(n+1)} = \emptyset\) since \(Y' = \emptyset\) for \(Y\) finite. \pause

*If* for all \(x \in [0, 2\pi]\) except for \(x \in X\) where \(X\) is a derived set of the \(n\)'th kind for some \(n\),
\[
f(x) = \sum c_n \sin(nx) + d_n \cos(nx) = \sum c_n' \sin(nx) + d_n' \cos(nx)
\]

*Then* \(c_n = c_n'\) and \(d_n = d_n'\) for every \(n\).

** Uniqueness of Fourier Series (Cantor) II: Proof
- Suppose \(X' = \{x_1, \cdots, x_k\}\) has only finitely many points.
- Order these points \(x_1 < x_2 < \cdots x_{k-1} < x_k\). \pause
- Consider \(a, b\) with \(x_i < a < b < x_{i+1}\), i.e. \((a,b) \subsetneq (x_i, x_{i+1})\) \pause
- Claim: \((a, b)\) contains at most finitely many points from \(X\) \pause
  - For otherwise, there we would be a limit point of \(X\) contained in \((a, b)\)! (Heine-Borel Theorem)
- The previous result applies and \(F\) is linear, once again giving the result. \pause
- Now proceed by induction:
  - Assume the result is true for \(n\)
  - If \(X\) is a derived set of the \((n+1)\)-th kind, then \(X^{(n+1)}\) is finite.
  - Apply the same argument to \(X^{(n)}'\)
